What is machine learning?
It is the field of study that gives the machine the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed for it.

Machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised learning:
    - used most in the real world applications
    - most advancements are observed
- Unsupervised Learning:
- Recommender Systems:
- Reinforcement Learning:
